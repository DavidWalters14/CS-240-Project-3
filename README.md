# CS-240-Project-3
This project was to implement a graph of planets, specifically the 3 nearest planets to a specified planet would be its "adjacent" planets ( the only planets it would be connected to ).  The goal was to implement dikjstra's shortest path algorithm to traverse the graph from one planet to another in the shortest amount of distance.  To run, clone and type "make run" in terminal.
